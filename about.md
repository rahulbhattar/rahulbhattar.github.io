<p>My name is Rahul Bhattar, and I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Dayton, which I completed in August 2023. With over 5 years of experience as a software developer, I have worked across diverse domains including healthcare, gaming, and government sectors.

Currently, I am working as a React Developer on a New Mexico State Government project through Deloitte. In this role, I’ve contributed to the modernization of legacy systems by developing scalable and accessible front-end applications using React and Redux, and building robust backend services using Node.js and Express.js. I also implemented CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, optimized performance, and followed best practices in code quality and accessibility.

Before this, I worked at Ivy Comptech, where I was part of the engineering team responsible for building high-performance gaming applications, including casino and party poker platforms.

I am passionate about crafting user-centric applications, solving complex problems, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software. I am currently seeking full-time opportunities where I can continue to grow as a React stack developer and contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.
